The Electron framework lets you write cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is based on Node.js and Chromium and is used by the Visual Studio Code and many other apps.

Installation
To install prebuilt Electron binaries, use npm. The preferred method is to install Electron as a development dependency in your app:

npm install electron --save-dev
For more installation options and troubleshooting tips, see installation. For info on how to manage Electron versions in your apps, see Electron versioning.

Platform support
Each Electron release provides binaries for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

macOS (Big Sur and up): Electron provides 64-bit Intel and Apple Silicon / ARM binaries for macOS.
Windows (Windows 10 and up): Electron provides ia32 (x86), x64 (amd64), and arm64 binaries for Windows. Windows on ARM support was added in Electron 5.0.8. Support for Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 was removed in Electron 23, in line with Chromium's Windows deprecation policy.
Linux: The prebuilt binaries of Electron are built on Ubuntu 20.04. They have also been verified to work on:
Ubuntu 18.04 and newer
Fedora 32 and newer
Debian 10 and newer
Quick start & Electron Fiddle
Use Electron Fiddle to build, run, and package small Electron experiments, to see code examples for all of Electron's APIs, and to try out different versions of Electron. It's designed to make the start of your journey with Electron easier.

Alternatively, clone and run the electron/electron-quick-start repository to see a minimal Electron app in action:

git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
cd electron-quick-start
npm install
npm start
Resources for learning Electron
electronjs.org/docs - All of Electron's documentation
electron/fiddle - A tool to build, run, and package small Electron experiments
electron/electron-quick-start - A very basic starter Electron app
electronjs.org/community#boilerplates - Sample starter apps created by the community
Programmatic usage
Most people use Electron from the command line, but if you require electron inside your Node app (not your Electron app) it will return the file path to the binary. Use this to spawn Electron from Node scripts:

const electron = require('electron')
const proc = require('node:child_process')

// will print something similar to /Users/maf/.../Electron
console.log(electron)

// spawn Electron
const child = proc.spawn(electron)
